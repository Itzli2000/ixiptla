    "title": "What is Ixiptla?",
    "description": "Ixiptla (or Ixiptla) comes from the Nahuatl roots 'xip' (skin, covering) and 'ixtli' (eyes, face, something on the surface of a conscious being). It represents not just an image or representation, but embodies a presence or skin - a vessel that actualizes power within an object or person.",
    "description2": "This concept is deeply rooted in Mesoamerican culture, exemplified in the deity Xipe Totec, often depicted wearing the flayed skin of another, where a person would become the deity's embodiment through ritual ceremony. Our work bridges this profound cultural heritage with contemporary design and technology."
